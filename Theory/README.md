## What is Inheritance ?
  => Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit *properties and 
  behavior(methods)* from an existing class (superclass or base class). This enables code re-use and facilitates the creation of hierarchies of classes with shared
  characteristics.

  Inheritance is depicted using an "is-a" relationship, where a subclass "is-a" type of its superclass. The subclass inherits all the attributes and methods of its 
  superclass and can also define its own attributes and methods.
