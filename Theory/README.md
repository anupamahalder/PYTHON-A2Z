## What is Inheritance ?
  => Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit *properties and 
  behavior(methods)* from an existing class (superclass or base class). This enables code re-use and facilitates the creation of hierarchies of classes with shared
  characteristics.

  Inheritance is depicted using an "is-a" relationship, where a subclass "is-a" type of its superclass. The subclass inherits all the attributes and methods of its 
  superclass and can also define its own attributes and methods.

## What is Encapsulation?
=> Encapsulation is the building of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single
unit, called a class. It is one of the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), along with
inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Encapsulation helps to hide the internal state of an object and only expose the necessary functionality, thus providing better control over access to the data.

## What are Access Modifiers?
=> Access Modifiers are keywords in programming languages that specify the accessibility of classes, attributes, methods, and other members of a class. They control how these members can be accessed and modifies from outside the class. Common access modifiers include public, private, and protected.
